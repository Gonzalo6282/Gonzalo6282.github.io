## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Cloud services

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="col d-flex justify-content-center">
      <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
        <img src="images\image-qr-code.png" class="card-img-top" alt="QR">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding-top: 0.75rem;
  padding-left: 0.75rem;
  padding-right: 0.75rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.75rem;
  border-radius: 7%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on React in my future projects. These are some of the concepts I am still not completely comfortable with, I really want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39031224/how-to-center-cards-in-bootstrap-4) - This helped me to center the card horizontally in the middle across the page.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62322171/how-to-round-the-corners-of-a-card-body-and-image-in-bootstrap-4) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to round image corners. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

I did get inspiration from Colt Steele, he is a coding instructor in Udemy. I'd recommend it to anyone that is learning programing to check some of his courses.
